#short

* shoot cannon:
the shoot may be executed direclty after the press, and the unction is kind of character::shoot\_left -> that shoot for the weapon 'left' that is equipped
so the function call cannon::shoot(body)
or cannon::shoot(id,x,y,angle) ?

better : cannon::shoot(id) and then it search for the info  .??/?!!

#plan

* complex wall triangled

* map from svg

* creation of a map

* boids

* weapon, damage..

* graphism

* when creating a shape we must not put redundant normal

* when collision check -> bounding box first

* Cannon more generic ->  shotgun, impact..
