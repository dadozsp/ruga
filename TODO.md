#map

* a map affect a texture to wall, rectangle, and circle

#short term

* still do the snake but not axis aligned and smaller 
  it has a constant velocity, and change its angle but
  the `delta_angle` is cannot be too high
  as in the screensaver m6502

* think of mosnters!

* COLLISION: when resolving overlap move in the direction perpendicular
  of the collision vector the length of the overlap

* real destroy
