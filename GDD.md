random map of different type

interior

exterior


the game is composed of about 10 map each one in a special environment (graphism, monsters, boss) you can make them in the order you want and their is difficulty of level.
also the map are of different size: 15 minute to 1 hour. and maybe a special one with indefinite time ?

the first time you have to unlock map then you can do whatever you want. maybe you have at any time two castle available.
also when you finish a castle you got a password kind of save state

when you finish the first set you can redo them in superior difficulty

#goal

defeat the minotaur.

there is also some over monster in the maze,

the maze is constructed from a chip

how is the minotaur ?? neural network. no

other monster : boids, updated every 300ms .,

#map description

maps are generated randomly.
we generate a desciptor and then compile the descriptor to actually having the map.

must take inspiration of random generation like rogue.

maybe : 
like a maze but not only one path, lots of path, at the beginning of the game you must find weapon is the maze and hide from the minotaur.
then when you got the weapon you want you have to kill the minotaur. like Evolve but in reverse.


#graphism

first environment : castle interior
* wall -> 12 tile
* floor -> 1 tile 
like in valdmor

use the technic of Gille for shadow

particles for shoot and hit
